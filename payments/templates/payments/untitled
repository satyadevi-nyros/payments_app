Currently I am getting authenticated user(credentials provided in our application) instead of public other user information.

I have tried to get other users public information but I am unable get it.why because I am getting error like this.

I have checked with many resources but I am unable find the solution.finally I have contacted with Linkedin support team and stackoverflow also.Now I am waiting for his response.
after getting response from  support I will let you know the possibilities sir.
